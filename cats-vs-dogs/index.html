<h1> Dogs Have Better Noses</h1>
<h2>Dogs can discriminate odors at concentrations nearly 100 million times lower than humans can. 
  <br>The wet nose is essential for determining the direction of the air current containing the smell. 
  <br>Cold receptors in the skin are sensitive to the cooling of the skin by evaporation of the moisture by air currents.</h2>

<h1>Cats Have Better Tongues</h1>
<h2>Cats are known for their cleanliness, spending many hours licking their coats. 
  <br>The cat's tongue has backwards-facing spines about 500 micrometers long, which are 
  <br>called papillae. These are quite rigid, as they contain keratin. 
  <br>These spines allow cats to groom themselves by licking their fur, with the rows of papillae acting like a hairbrush. </h2>
